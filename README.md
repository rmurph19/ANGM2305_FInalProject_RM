## Description
    Shapes in Time is a game where you must quickly switch between and match shapes to different enemy attacks in order to win. The player character can switch between being a circle, square, or triangle which corresponds to the enemey's attack shapes. 

    At the start, the player will notice enemies spawning as red circles, but instead of fighting the enemies directly, the player will fight their attacks by matching to themselves to the attack's shapes. The attacks come in different flavors of light, medium, heavy. Light attacks are quick but do less damage than the heavy attacks. Missing an attack or matching with an incorrect shape will cause the player to lose health. The gameplay is about making quick choices on which shapes to match, and which to sacrifice. The more enemies that are spawned on the map indicates to the player that the difficulty is increasing. Once the player achieves 15 score, they have won the game.

    Overall, I am pleased with the game. In its current state, it runs as a fun and simple proof of concept. The worst bug that I was not able to iron out was the shapes will sometimes spawn on top of the player, which does not give them enough time to react. In the future I would want to iron that out and maybe adjust the difficulty to allow for continued play.
