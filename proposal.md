## Description
Shapes and Time will be a game where the player has to rapidly switch between 3 different shapes (square, circle, triangle) in order to match their shape to enemies' attacks. Matching the correct shapes at the correct time will defeat the enemies and win the game.

## Features
- Interactivity
    - The player will be able to move about the canvas and interact with elements on the screen.
- Scaling
    - Elements such as enemies' attacks will vary in size and rate of shrinking depending on
    how strong the attack is. ex: Light attacks quickly shrink but do less damage if missed. Heavy attacks are big and shrink slowly but do lots of damage if missed.
- Screen/Canvas Resize
    - The screen can resize similarly to how we achieved this in Lab 08.
- Ramping Difficulty
    - Each enemy defeated will increase the difficulty by adding more enemies to manage.
- Score system
    - Players will be able to keep track of their high score.

## Challenges
- More advanced interactivity, such as moving a character on the screen with input.
- Switching sprites.
- Scoring System.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, The game would have one level that ramps up in difficulty, where each time an enemy is defeated more spawn in. The player can move around the 2D canvas and can perform the shape matching mechanic. Each enemy defeated adds to a highscore, which is saved and shown to the player. The screen can also be resized for quality of life. 

Minimum Viable Outcome:
- One enemy type with no ramping difficulty or score system. The player has full interactivity and can perform the shape matching mechanic.
